# AdventOfCode
Collection of AoC Solutions over the years. No guarantees regarding completeness or correctness.

Over the next few weeks/months I plan to migrate all my solutions from past years into this repo (and maybe clean them up a bit).

I also plan to add solution for 2018 as I get around to coding them. Starting December I will probably switch to doing the newest ones first.

Feel free to use these solution for inspiration or whatever else just keep in mind that I'm not investing that much time into these solutions so they might not always be very performant or even correct for all inputs. Use at your own peril.

Oh, in case you have no idea what I am talking about but are still reading, look here: www.adventofcode.com
